# Physical Layer (OSI Model)

## ðŸ”¹ What is the Physical Layer?
- The **first (bottom-most) layer** of the OSI model.
- Deals with the **actual physical connection** between devices.
- Responsible for transmitting **raw bits (0s and 1s)** over a medium like cables or radio waves.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Functions
1. **Transmission of bits** â€“ Converts data (0s and 1s) into signals (electrical, optical, or radio) and sends them.  
2. **Medium of transmission** â€“ Defines how data travels (copper wires, fiber optic, wireless, etc.).  
3. **Bit rate control** â€“ Decides how fast bits are sent (bps).  
4. **Physical topology** â€“ Defines how devices are physically connected (bus, star, ring, mesh).  
5. **Synchronization** â€“ Ensures sender and receiver are in sync while sending/receiving bits.  
6. **Physical characteristics** â€“ Deals with voltage levels, cables, connectors, frequencies.

## ðŸ”¹ Examples of Physical Layer Devices
- Hubs  
- Repeaters  
- Cables (Ethernet, fiber optic)  
- Connectors (RJ45, coaxial)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Simple Analogy
Think of the Physical Layer like a **road**:
- It doesnâ€™t care what type of vehicle (data) is moving.  
- It just provides the **path and rules (width, lanes, signals)** so vehicles can travel.

## ðŸ‘‰ In Short
The **Physical Layer is all about hardware and signals**.  
It ensures that **raw data (bits) physically moves from one device to another**.
